With the implementation of dynamic website named Catalogue Management System, the main aim is to provide a hassle free course selection for students for upcoming semesters where an advisor/staff will make necessary changes to the courses with respective professorâ€™s consent and present them officially to students so they can choose and enroll for the courses after discussing with advisors.
